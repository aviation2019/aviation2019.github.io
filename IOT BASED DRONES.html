						<header class="major"><strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong> Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), or drones as they are often called, are increasingly available online and on store shelves. Prospective operators—from consumers to businesses—want to fly and fly safely, but many don’t realize that, just because you can easily acquire a UAS. The FAA’s final rule for small, unmanned aircraft went into effect on August 29, 2016. It provides specific safety regulations for non-recreational use of unmanned aircraft weighing less than 55 pounds. That means UAS users who want to fly for commercial use (such as providing aerial surveying or photography services) or fly incidental to a business (such as performing roof inspections or real estate photography) must follow certain regulations. 
						Drones have made the news lately because of their ability to fly in fairly tight spaces, carrying cameras or dangerous payloads. With all of these camera-equipped drones flying in the sky, the public has been freaking out a bit over privacy concerns. The FAA has also been concerned about the potential damage that drones can cause to people and property.
                        The rise of drones has not escaped the commercial world. Back in 2013, Amazon stated that it wanted to leverage drones to deliver packages in record time. The government has been leveraging drones—radio-controlled and autonomous—for years. Of course, there are thousands of people out there who leverage drones for aerial photography applications. The movie and TV industries find drones to be a cheap way to get some amazing shots without renting a full-sized helicopter. <p></p>

            <p><strong>FACTS ABOUT DRONE:</strong> <strong>	Only the police and the military use drones</strong> but Drone uses have expanded. Many civilians fly them these days. Modern ones like the DJI Phantom 3 or the Niño QX bring joy to many avid hobbyists </p>
		<p><strong>FUTURE OF IOT-DRONES:</strong> Drone technology is evolving very rapidly. Drones are already beginning to efficiently replace the connected sensors at rest with one device that is:
        1.	deployable to different locations
        2.	capable of carrying flexible payloads
        3.	re-programmable in mission
        4.	Able to measure just about anything, anywhere.
            All drones are not equal. Some like the Global Hawk are very complex systems that are connected to satellites and are only the purview of the military. Others like the Parrot A.R. Drone are mass-produced hobby aircraft that you can control with your mobile device.  But a class of drones in the middle combines the capabilities of both complex and mass-produced systems and is specifically designed for commercial purposes. These drones weight less than 55 lbs. and are classified by regulatory entities as small unmanned aircraft systems or sUAS.  We don’t see their ubiquitous use in the U.S. quite yet, but in countries like England, Australia, and France, you will find them operating in energy, mining, mapping, and surveying companies – and quite a few government agencies like those responsible for transportation and infrastructure. Commercial drones are truly ‘unmanned aircraft systems’.  They are not just remote controlled aircraft.  They require many things in order to run, like avionics, ground control stations, communication systems, data collection and processing software, and of course GPS for geo-referencing. There’s more, but you get the idea. These are multifaceted complex vehicles whose mission is to fly sensors and collect data. Commercial drones are also connected devices. So they are ‘things in motion’. Most are accessible or controllable over the Internet, and the data they collect is pushed to various cloud services. Some drones are beginning to carry on-board processors as well and are now part of the growing trend of fog computing devices.

            <p><strong>	All drones have weapons</strong> .Not all drones do. Drones help people in many ways. While some drones have military uses, others are used for photography and other purposes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>	Drones cannot stay in the air for long.</strong> Lightweight drones like the Blade Nano QX or the Hubsan X4 cannot remain in the air for more than 10 minutes . </p>
            
            <p><strong>	Israel was the first country to build drones.</strong>strong The first country to manufacture drones was Israel. Israel Aerospace Industries has production facilities about 24 countries around the world.</p>

		<p>Some industry players call these vehicles UAVs, and others, RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems). They feel that RPAS are different because a pilot controls them from a distant location.</p>

            <p><strong>CHALLENGES DUE TO DRONE:</strong>
Privacy infrastructure: Privacy infrastructure assuming that technical challenges related to drones and localization can be addressed eventually, drone-based privacy interfaces need to be provided with information about data practices and information flows in the smart environment. Privacy systems and infrastructure are required to detect and model information flows between sensors and devices. A potential approach is the specification of data practices in machine-readable privacy policies and their distribution in the smart environment, which would not only enable drone-based privacy interfaces, but device-independent privacy awareness and control tools in general... While much focus has been placed on expressing data practices in machine-readable formats, exposing control APIs, user choices, and privacy settings to other systems is an equally important challenge. Creating infrastructures that can collect and exchange privacy relevant information about devices in a smart environment or an individual’s vicinity would enable the aggregation of privacy settings and privacy management functionality for multiple devices in a consistent interface, which may be drone based, but 3 could also be provided on a tablet, mobile device, wall display or computer. Such aggregation of privacy information and settings would facilitate contextualized privacy decision making support and has the potential to reduce user-burden by providing user’s personal recommendations and automating certain privacy decisions and setting configuration for the user.
</p>
                <p><strong>NEXT UPDATE:</strong> We are only beginning to find out how drones can be used to replace multiple sensors. Surely this technology will push the bounds of how we can measure and analyze ‘things at rest’ and ‘things in motion’ and how they can interact with both of them.</p>
